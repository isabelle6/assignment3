        <p>We here at Guitar Shredders are committed to helping out the community. Since 1989, every year we donate guitars to music programs in different schools in the community. Twice a year we have Play to Help week, where we donate 50% of the proceeds from that week and donate it to school music programs. </p>

        <p>John Doe founded Guitar Shredders in 1984, after being frustrated for so many years with other guitar distribution companies. He did not like the fact that if you wanted a nice quality guitar, you had to spend a lot of money. After lots of planning and hard work, Guitar Shredders was born.</p>
